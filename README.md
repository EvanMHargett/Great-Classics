<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Great Classics is a clone of GoodReads based around classic novels. Users are able to browse, review, search, organize and keep track of their progress on classical novels. The site uses User-based session authentication to interact with the website and access these features. 

## Feature Highlights

### Utilizing React to create a single page application

- React was utilized to eliminate the need for any page refreshes such that navigation is smooth


### Implementing Redux for a fast access of information

- All relevant information for the page is stored via Redux, such that when a user needs to access something it appears very quickly


## Project Challenges

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Great Classics was the first project I created that utilized React and Redux. The workflow took some getting used to, but was a very valuable experience due to the power of both of those technologies. Additionally, this was the first full stack application I produced solo. This was a good, but challenging experience to plan and execute all parts of the application without much outside assistance. 


### Built With

* [CSS]()
